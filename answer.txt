Question1: https://github.com/XuantongMa/CMPUT-404-Lab4-F22

Question2: The browser shows "The install worked successfully!".

Question3: When navigating to "/", the browser shows "Page not found (404)". When navigating to "/polls", the browser shows "Hello, world. You're at the polls index.".

Question4: Migration is the way of propagating changes to the models into the database. It helps to tell Django that I make changes to the models and edit the database. 

Question5: There are Choices and Questions models under the POLLS section. We can set up the models and use the python code "admin.site.register(model)".

Question6: /polls/38 shows "You're looking at question 38."
	/polls/38/results shows "You're looking at the results of question 38."
	/polls/38/vote shows "You're voting on question 38."
	If I put a string ,the browser shows "Page not found 404"
	To modify the code, we need to change the type of "question_id" from int to str.
